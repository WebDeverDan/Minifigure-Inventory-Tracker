  # The Lego Collector
  
  ## Description
  
  * A personal project which was finalized in a period of 3 weeks, this application is aimed at a Lego collector, with the functionality of adding, updating, and deleting figures and sets. Being a collector myself, I wanted to create a simple and useful way to keep track of my collection. This application utilizes Handlebars.js on the frontend and a database backend of MySQL, operated by Sequelize. Future development for the application includes downloading a .csv file of your collection, uploading a .csv file into your application, a way to see other users' collections (on the high-end level), and possibly adding other collectible categories to the application (action figures, stamps, coins, etc.). Enjoy, and happy collecting!
